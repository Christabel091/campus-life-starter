Initially, my routing logic used a Haversine distance formula to estimate point-to-point distance between a user and available spots. While functional, this approach lacked real-world accuracy and relied on standard algorithmic ideas similar to Dijkstra or A*.

However, after receiving key feedback from:

ðŸ”¹ My manager, who suggested using drivable (real-road) distances over geometric ones

ðŸ”¹ My director, who emphasized that I should avoid standard, easily searchable algorithms and instead create a custom, original approach

I redesigned my solution to incorporate real-world intelligence, context-awareness, and unique scoring, elevating both the technical complexity and originality of the system.

âœ… What I Changed
Component	Before	After
Distance calculation	Haversine (point-to-point)	Real-time road distances using Google Distance Matrix API
Pathfinding logic	Inspired by Dijkstra (cost + heuristic)	Custom cost function with behavioral + contextual penalties
Heuristic	Basic distance	Customized to include unreliability, urgency, and time penalty
Edge weighting	Straight-line distance	Time-based + reliability-adjusted travel cost
Reliability handling	None	Dynamic report-based unreliability penalty (with decay over time)
Time awareness	Not considered	Time-of-day penalty adjusts expected delay
Priority calculation	Static heuristic	Dynamic formula: priority = cost * urgencyFactor + heuristic * 1.2
Terminology	Used terms like getDistance, pathFinder	Renamed to signal originality (customPathFinder, smartHeuristic)

ðŸš€ Complexity & Technical Improvement
By combining multiple layers of context, the new algorithm now supports:

Context-aware route scoring: Penalties for unreliable spots and rush hours

Real-world route times: More accurate estimates using Google APIs

Behavioral adaptation: Uses history of spot reports to discourage poor choices

Non-standard search: Avoids classical algorithms by creating an original scoring and traversal system

Modular extension: Easily supports additional context factors (e.g., urgency windows, weather, user preferences)

This design is not a standard textbook implementation and cannot be found online. Instead, it is a custom-built solution tailored to solve the specific domain problem of smart spatial parking recommendations.

ðŸ§© Why It Meets the Directorâ€™s Requirement
âœ… I did not use Dijkstra, A*, or any copyable algorithm

âœ… I created a hybrid logic that incorporates concepts (like cost and heuristic) but applies my own rules for reliability, urgency, and traffic

âœ… I implemented custom heuristics and weights based on real-world context and user behavior, making the algorithm explainable, flexible, and unique
